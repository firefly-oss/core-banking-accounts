 * Represents a space or bucket within a banking account.

 * Business Rules:
 * - Each account must have at least one MAIN space
 * - Spaces can have their own balance, but the sum of all space balances must equal the account's total balance
 * - Spaces can have goals and target amounts
 * - Custom spaces can be created with user-defined names
 * - Spaces can have automatic transfers configured
